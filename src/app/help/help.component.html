    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in a role at Ito World, we’re really looking
      forward to finding out more about you and seeing how you could be part of
      our team of talented engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exercise gives us the opportunity to see how you approach a software
      engineering problem and your knowledge of HTML, CSS, Angular, Typescript
      and RxJS. Unlike a timed test, there are no constraints on how long you
      spend on the implementation but we’d suggest no more than two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you produce your solution, please consider not just the functionality
      and styling, but also what you would do to ensure your implementation is
      robust, maintainable and free of memory leaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you start please Fork the stackblitz project and when you are ready
      to submit please share your stackblitz link with us.

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <h4>Primary objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a login form that has an email input, a password input and a
        submit button. Use the <code>LoginComponent</code> for this.
      </li>
      <li>On successful login the user is redirected to the dashboard page.</li>
      <li>
        The <code>/dashboard</code> route must only be accesible to
        authenticated users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Secondary objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The login page should be styled similar to the image provided.</li>
      <li>The email field should have a required validator.</li>
      <li>The email field should have a valid email format validator.</li>
      <li>The password field should have a required validator.</li>
      <li>
        If an incorrect email and password combination is entered an error
        message should be displayed on submit.
      </li>
      <li>
        If am logged in the <code>/login</code> route should redirect to the
        dashboard.
      </li>
      <li>Dispay the user's details on the dashboard in any way you like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Focus on completing the primary objectives first before moving onto the
        secondary ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <code>AuthenticationService</code> to hold the state of your
        logged in user. You will need to implement the
        <code>login()</code> method here.
      </li>
      <li>
        An <code>AuthGuard</code> has already been set on the
        <code>/dashboard</code> route, but you will need to implement the
        <code>canActive()</code> method.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>ApiService</code> provides a fake endpoint to authenticate a
        user, so you don't need to worry about cookies or storing tokens in
        local storage or anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>login()</code> method in <code>ApiService</code> will return a
        <code>User</code> if the email and password match those stored in
        <code>usersDb</code>. So you can test your login form using the email
        and password of the user defined there.
      </li>
    </ul>
